# MyResume

A native Android app that displays the user's CV/resume digitally.

# App Description 

 The application was written using Kotlin and the Android Framework. The UI for the app was designed with XML. It was built using the Single-Activity Architecture with multiple Fragments.
 
 # Design
 
 Two designs on the web served as inspiration for the design of this app:
 
 1. [Digital Resume - Mobile Version by Mathieu Hervouet](https://www.behance.net/gallery/9600233/Digital-Resume-Mobile-Version)
 2. [The design on the CareerLyft homepage](https://web2.careerlyft.com/features/mobile-friendly/)
 
 The Montserrat font-family was used in each screen, and icons from [Icons8](https://icons8.com/icons/material) were used throughout the app.
 The Navigation Drawer pattern was used so as to provide easy access to each destination in the app.
 The app consists of five screens, which represent five different sections in a resume: 
 
 * About Me
 * Work Experience
 * Education
 * Skills
 * Contact Me
 
 # Libraries and Tools used
 
 * Viewbinding - For easy access to individual UI views/components in code.
 * Navigation Component - For setting up the navigation to and from different screens/destinations in the app.
 * Material Design Components - Components like Material Toolbar and Navigation Drawer were used to give the app a nice look and feel.
 * CircleImageView - For creating round-shaped images in the app.
 
 # Nice-to-haves 
 
 Given more time, I would incorporate these features into the app:
 
 * Dark mode
 * Different languages
 * User customization
 * Conversion of the CV/resume in the app to PDF version
 
 # Challenges 
 
 The major challenge I faced was the time constraint. I could not add all the features I desired to because of it, and the fact that I work full-time. However, being able to come up with a minimun viable product in such a short time has taught me about speed in writing code and building a product.
