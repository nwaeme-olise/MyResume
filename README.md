# MyResume

A native Android app that displays the user's CV/resume digitally.

# App Description 

 The application was written using Kotlin and the Android Framework. The UI for the app was designed with XML. It was built using the Single-Activity Architecture with multiple Fragments.
 
 # Design
 
 Two designs on the web served as inspiration for the design of this app:
 
 1. [Digital Resume - Mobile Version by Mathieu Hervouet](https://www.behance.net/gallery/9600233/Digital-Resume-Mobile-Version)
 2. [The design on the CareerLyft homepage](https://web2.careerlyft.com/features/mobile-friendly/)
 
 The Montserrat font-family was used in each screen.
 The Navigation Drawer pattern was used so as to provide easy access to each destination in the app.
 The app consists of five screens, which represent five different sections in a resume: 
 
 * About Me
 * Work Experience
 * Education
 * Skills
 * Contact Me
